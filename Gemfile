# If you're working on more than one datamapper gem at a time, then it's
# recommended to create a local Gemfile and use this instead of the git
# sources. This will make sure that you are  developing against your
# other local datamapper sources that you currently work on. Gemfile.local
# will behave identically to the standard Gemfile apart from the fact that
# it fetches the datamapper gems from local paths. This means that you can use
# the same environment variables, like ADAPTER(S) or PLUGIN(S) when running
# bundle commands. Gemfile.local is added to .gitignore, so you don't need to
# worry about accidentally checking local development paths into git.
# In order to create a local Gemfile, all you need to do is run:
#
#   bundle exec rake local_gemfile
#
# This will give you a Gemfile.local file that points to your local clones of
# the various datamapper gems. It's assumed that all datamapper repo clones
# reside in the same directory. You can use the Gemfile.local like so for
# running any bundle command:
#
#   BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.local bundle foo
#
# You can also specify which adapter(s) should be part of the bundle by setting
# an environment variable. This of course also works when using the Gemfile.local
#
#   bundle foo                        # dm-sqlite-adapter
#   ADAPTER=mysql bundle foo          # dm-mysql-adapter
#   ADAPTERS=sqlite,mysql bundle foo  # dm-sqlite-adapter and dm-mysql-adapter
#
# Of course you can also use the ADAPTER(S) variable when using the Gemfile.local
# and running specs against selected adapters.
#
# For easily working with adapters supported on your machine, it's recommended
# that you first install all adapters that you are planning to use or work on
# by doing something like
#
#   ADAPTERS=sqlite,mysql,postgres bundle install
#
# This will clone the various repositories and make them available to bundler.
# Once you have them installed you can easily switch between adapters for the
# various development tasks. Running something like
#
#   ADAPTER=mysql bundle exec rake spec
#
# will make sure that the dm-mysql-adapter is part of the bundle, and will be used
# when running the specs.
#
# You can also specify which plugin(s) should be part of the bundle by setting
# an environment variable. This also works when using the Gemfile.local
#
#   bundle foo                                 # dm-migrations
#   PLUGINS=dm-validations bundle foo          # dm-migrations and dm-validations
#   PLUGINS=dm-validations,dm-types bundle foo # dm-migrations, dm-validations and dm-types
#
# Of course you can combine the PLUGIN(S) and ADAPTER(S) env vars to run specs
# for certain adapter/plugin combinations.
#
# Finally, to speed up running specs and other tasks, it's recommended to run
#
#   bundle lock
#
# after running 'bundle install' for the first time. This will make 'bundle exec' run
# a lot faster compared to the unlocked version. With an unlocked bundle you would
# typically just run 'bundle install' from time to time to fetch the latest sources from
# upstream. When you locked your bundle, you need to run
#
#   bundle install --relock
#
# to make sure to fetch the latest updates and then lock the bundle again. Gemfile.lock
# is added to the .gitignore file, so you don't need to worry about accidentally checking
# it into version control.
